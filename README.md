# project-wyse
Getting started with Dell Wyse 3040 thin client as a Raspberry Pi 4 alternative

## initial ideas
- install Debian as a minimal installation
- install Arch
- run it as a disk nuking machine (4 USB Ports are available)
- run Pi-hole
- run RetroPie
- run various Distros from USB Stick (Debian with GNOME, Kali Linux with XFCE)
- try out Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
- try out pre-installed ThinOS
